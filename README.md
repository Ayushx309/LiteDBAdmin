## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushx309/LiteDBAdmin.git
   ```

2. Configure your database connection:
   - Update `src/LiteDBAdmin/config.php` with your database credentials
   - Or modify the path in `src/LiteDBAdmin/index.php` to point to your existing configuration

3. Configure your web server:
   - Ensure Apache/Nginx is set up to serve the project directory
   - Verify PHP 7.4+ is installed and properly configured

4. Access the application:
   ```
   http://localhost/path-to-LiteDBAdmin/src/
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

LiteDBAdmin is highly configurable through the `src/LiteDBAdmin/config.php` file. Here are the key configuration options:

### Database Connection
```php
$host = "localhost";      // Database host
$username = "root";       // Database username
$password = "";           // Database password
$database = "mysql";      // Default database
```

### Security Settings
```php
$dev_password = "@ayushx309@";  // Developer access password - CHANGE THIS!
$max_login_attempts = 5;        // Maximum login attempts before lockout
$lockout_time = 30 * 60;        // Lockout duration in seconds (30 minutes)
```

### Session Configuration
```php
$session_timeout = 3600;        // Session timeout (1 hour)
```

### Performance Settings
```php
$max_execution_time = 30;       // Maximum query execution time (in seconds)
```

### Error Reporting
Error reporting is automatically enabled on development environments (localhost or domains starting with 'dev.') and disabled in production.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage Guide

1. **Login**: Enter your developer password in the secure login page
   ```php
   // Current login password is set in src/LiteDBAdmin/config.php
   $dev_password = "@ayushx309@"; // You should change this immediately after installation
   ```

2. **Browse Tables**: 
   - Click any table name in the sidebar to generate a SELECT query
   - View table structure by using the info icon next to table names

3. **Execute Queries**:
   - Write SQL in the editor and click Execute or press Ctrl+Enter
   - View results in the formatted table below
   - Check execution time for performance analysis

4. **Natural Language Queries**:
   - Type a question like "Show me all users who registered in the last month"
   - Select an AI provider and click "Convert to SQL"
   - Review and execute the generated query

5. **Switch Databases**:
   - Select a different database from the dropdown to change context
   - Tables will automatically refresh to show the selected database's structure

6. **Schema Visualization**:
   - View the database schema diagram to understand table relationships
   - Hover over connections to see relationship details

7. **Export Data**:
   - Execute a query and use the export options for the results
   - Export to SQL for database transfers or CSV for spreadsheet analysis

8. **Dark Mode**:
   - Toggle the theme using the Dark Mode button in the sidebar
   - Preference is saved between sessions

## üîí Security Recommendations

The current authentication system is basic and designed for development environments. For production use, consider these improvements:

1. **Enhanced Authentication**:
   - Implement a proper user management system with hashed passwords
   - Add user roles and permissions (Admin, Developer, Readonly)
   - Consider OAuth integration for enterprise environments

2. **Additional Security Layers**:
   - IP-based access restrictions
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Audit logging for all database operations
   - SSL/TLS for all connections

3. **Query Restrictions**:
   - Limit which operations can be performed on production databases
   - Add confirmation for potentially destructive operations (DROP, DELETE)
   - Set timeout limits for long-running queries

4. **Configuration Security**:
   - Move `config.php` outside of web-accessible directories
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information instead of hardcoding
   - Implement proper password hashing instead of plaintext passwords

  - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
  - JavaScript for interactive features
  - Cytoscape.js for database schema visualization

- **Custom Themes**: More visual customization options
- **Query Templates**: Pre-built common query patterns
- **API Access**: RESTful API for programmatic access
